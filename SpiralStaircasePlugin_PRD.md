# Spiral Staircase Plugin PRD

## Product Overview
The Spiral Staircase Plugin for AutoCAD automates the creation and validation of spiral staircases based on specific architectural parameters. It ensures compliance with IRC R311.7.10.1 building codes while providing intuitive design capabilities.

## User Stories

### Architect/Designer
- As an architect, I want the plugin to calculate spiral stair parameters (center pole diameter, outside diameter, total rotation) so I can quickly generate compliant staircases.
- I need the plugin to provide mid-landing support for staircases over 147 inches in height to ensure safety and accessibility.

### Contractor/Builder
- As a contractor, I want the plugin to validate designs against IRC codes so I can ensure compliance before construction.
- I need the ability to export stair models in standard AutoCAD formats (DWG, DXF) for seamless integration with other construction software.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Spiral Stair Parameters**
   - Center Pole Diameter: Adjustable (6" - 12") in 1/2" increments
   - Overall Height: User-defined with automatic step dimension calculations
   - Outside Diameter: Customizable based on building envelope constraints
   - Total Rotation: Configurable (180° - 360°)
   - Mid-Landing Support: Mandatory for heights >147"

2. **IRC R311.7.10.1 Compliance**
   - Automated code validation
   - Clear error reporting for non-compliant designs
   - Step-by-step guidance for achieving compliance

3. **Mid-Landing Support**
   - Structural analysis for mid-landing strength
   - Compliance checks for mid-landing dimensions
   - Automatic generation of supporting elements

### Performance Requirements
- Real-time parameter updates with visual feedback
- Fast rendering and calculation times
- Minimal impact on AutoCAD performance ( <10% overhead)

### User Interface Requirements
- Intuitive parameter input interface
- Clear visual feedback in AutoCAD
- Detailed calculation preview before generation
- Export options for 2D/3D models
